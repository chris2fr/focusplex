# Why ToDo

## 

## Cascaded Sharing

A user may share any goal, objective or activity with others.

## Idea for the To Do Die

A TODO die would have six sides, like any die, inspired by the symbols above the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 on the US keyboard :

1. ! - Why (alternatively ?)
2. @ - Who
3. &#35; (hashtag) - What
4. $ - How
5. % - When 
6. ^ - Where

These could be extra fields for each todo. Each definition of a field could actually be variable.

WHY could be a todo or field of characters.

WHO could be a distinct object, either a person, an abstract concept or an organization, or a link in an LDAP directory, or a user account

WHAT could be a todo or a text field

HOW could be money, a howto document, a description (text area/document)

WHEN could be a point in time, a duration in time, a duration, a set of work sessions (past and to come), and a time of day

WHERE could be a URL, an address, geo coordonates, a concept, etc

This chapter could be relegated to a TODO.md file.
