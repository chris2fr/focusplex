# Why ToDo

## Import and Export Whats

It would be nice to be able to export branches, trees and leaves of whats and to import them too.

## Unit Tests and Documentation

Code elegantly.

## Confirm the Who User Proxy Object

The data model considers the "Who" table to be, among other things, a proxy for users. We should make sure that this works correctly insomuch as the What object is linked to the Who object. Linking the What object to a application user could be inelegant.

## Review Ordering Options

Perhaps consider alphabetical order from within the lists, still having the top todos first. 

## Detach from Admin Pages 

At the current time every user needs to be a super-user with admin pages that give access to all todos in the website. The change would be to not rely on these outside admin pages for management of the todo lists.

## Integrate In-Place Editing   

The idea is to click on a line and make it directly editable.

## Have a More Appealing / Usable Layout

I really haven't paid any attention to the layout of the application. It would be nice to make it prettier and perhaps more ergonomic. 

## Drag and Drop

It would be useful to move and rearrange the todos by drag and drop. Any todo can be filed under an other why.

## Cascaded Sharing

A user may share any goal, objective or activity with others.

## Idea for the To Do Die

A TODO die would have six sides, like any die, inspired by the symbols above the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 on the US keyboard :

1. ! - Why (alternatively ?)
2. @ - Who
3. &#35; (hashtag) - What
4. $ - How
5. % - When 
6. ^ - Where

These could be extra fields for each todo. Each definition of a field could actually be variable.

WHY could be a todo or field of characters.

WHO could be a distinct object, either a person, an abstract concept or an organization, or a link in an LDAP directory, or a user account

WHAT could be a todo or a text field

HOW could be money, a howto document, a description (text area/document)

WHEN could be a point in time, a duration in time, a duration, a set of work sessions (past and to come), and a time of day

WHERE could be a URL, an address, geo coordonates, a concept, etc

This chapter could be relegated to a TODO.md file.
