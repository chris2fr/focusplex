# Django Why Application

This application takes a perspective on todo lists. Why do we do what we do? I often forget myself. The point here is remember why I do what I do. The application does this by inserting a 'why' into the todo list. In order to achieve some goal I do some activity. The goal and the thing are both representable by 'todo' items. 

You can use this at :

## Use

As a list progresses, the activities can become intermediate goals with other activities attached to them. Therefor, and this is important, the new intermediate is strictly the same as a previous activity. The todo is both an intermediate goal and an intermediate activity. The trunck todos are goals, the branch todos are intermediate activities at their base, the branch todos are intermediate goals at their bifurcations, and the leaf todos are activities.

Practicaly, it is presented in the following format :

TO WHY DO HOW.

Both WHY and HOW are TODO items. A TODO is composed of a verb without in the infinitive form without the 'to' and a verb usually with a direct complement. I just learned that this is called a "non-finite verb phrase."

The simplicity is beautiful. There is no tree view actually, just a table view. Everything is on one page.
